            The animation exporter tool exports animation as separate .fbx files for each chosen AnimBot clip in a scene.
            Features:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                output files are stripped down to only the skeleton and face information objects. All that is needed for animation and nothing more!
            </li>
            <li>
                for animations with two players ("co-op emotes") it exports the wanted animations for both participants as separate files
                (with a name prefix to tell which player the animation is for)
            </li>
            <li>
                root joint animation can be kept or removed
            </li>
            <li>
                optional props can be added by selecting prop objects in the scene. The prop mesh is then exported, 
                and the skeleton is restructured to include the prop. In the Unity prefab for the character, the prop is added, 
                and gets animated as part of the character
            </li>
            <li>
                files/takes can be renamed to fit naming conventions. For example adding the character name as a prefix
            </li>
            <li>
                validates that clips follow naming conventions and highlights issues with red. 
                If the animator tries to export them anyway there is a warning which specifies the exact problems
            </li>
            <li>
                export settings are saved in the scene 
            </li>
            <li>
                to make sure errors aren't destructive, the file is saved before export and re-opened on completion (or on error)
            </li>
        </ul>
