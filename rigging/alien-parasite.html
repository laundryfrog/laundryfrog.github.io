        <p>
            This was the player character in my final game project at Futuregames. I was responsible for rigging and everything related to animation,
            the rest of the group consisting of a character artist, an environment artist, and 3 game designers/programmers.
            The game was made in unity during 8 weeks.

            <p>
                Knowing animation is one of my weaker suits, I pushed for a character design with a prominent tail which I wanted to procedurally animate. 
                This way the movement would look more natural and hopefully disguise my lack of skill!
