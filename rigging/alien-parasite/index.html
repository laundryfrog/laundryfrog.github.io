            This was the player character in my final game project at Futuregames. I was responsible for rigging and everything related to animation,
            the rest of the group consisted of a character artist, an environment artist, and 3 game designers/programmers.
            The game was made in unity during 8 weeks.

            Knowing animation is one of my weaker suits, I wanted to try out procedural animation for the tail to make the movement look more natural when moving around, and hide my lack of skill.
